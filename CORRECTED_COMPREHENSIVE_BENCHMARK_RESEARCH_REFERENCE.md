### 2.3 Evaluation Metrics (CORRECTED)


#### 2.3.1 Primary Metrics

**Accuracy (Exact Match)**
- **Definition**: Percentage of cases where predicted score exactly matches expected score
- **Formula**: `Accuracy = (Exact Matches / Total Evaluations) × 100%`
- **Range**: 0-100% (higher is better)
- **Interpretation**: Measures precise scoring capability

**Quality Score (Normalized Performance)**
- **Definition**: Normalized measure indicating prediction closeness to expected scores
- **Formula**: `Quality Score = 100% × (1 - normalized_distance)`
- **Normalized Distance Calculation**: `|predicted_score - expected_score| / max_score_for_task`
